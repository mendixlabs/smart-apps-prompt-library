# Smart Apps Prompt Library
Welcome to my Prompt Library! Prompt engineering has been a hot topic ever since Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular. This repository is all about understanding how to communicate effectively with generative AI models by crafting the right prompts. Even with today's advanced models that interpret user intent more easily, mastering prompt engineering can still be a challengeâ€”especially if you're new to it.

That's why we created this collection of prompts. Here, you'll find examples ranging from the basics to advanced concepts like function-calling prompts. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute. Let's make prompt engineering a skill anyone can master!

## Structure
You can find the prompts, a description, scope and explaination of the prompt in the **prompt-reference** folder. We have the following categories and prompt examples:

### assistants
- Focuses on basic conversational UI prompts.
  - prompt-1_mendix-assistant.md
  - prompt-2_sales-assistant.md

### complexity-reduction
- Aimed at simplifying complex topics and generating summaries.
  - prompt-1_simplification-assistant.md
  - prompt-2_meeting-transcript-assistant.md

### embeddings
- Deals with clustering, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation.
  - prompt-1_cluster-naming-assistant.md
  - prompt-2_RAG.md
  - prompt-3_semantic-search.md

### function-calling-and-RAG
- Focuses on using functions to assist with task automation and retrieval-augmented generation.
  - prompt-1_support-assistant.md

### predictive-conversational-assistant
- Involves creating predictive conversation flows and dynamic responses.
  - prompt-1_conversational-assistant.md
