# Smart Apps Prompt Library
Welcome to my Prompt Library! Prompt engineering has been a hot topic ever since Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular. This repository is all about understanding how to communicate effectively with generative AI models by crafting the right prompts. Even with today's advanced models that interpret user intent more easily, mastering prompt engineering can still be a challengeâ€”especially if you're new to it.

That's why we created this collection of prompts. Here, you'll find examples ranging from the basics to advanced concepts like function-calling prompts and tree-of-thought techniques. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute. Let's make prompt engineering a skill anyone can master!
