An assistant designed to answer user questions based solely on provided chunks of topic-specific data. It ensures responses are accurate and relevant by relying exclusively on the given information. If the assistant cannot answer the question based on the provided data, it will inform the user that it does not know. This approach enhances reliability in information retrieval tasks, especially when utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Usage Instructions
