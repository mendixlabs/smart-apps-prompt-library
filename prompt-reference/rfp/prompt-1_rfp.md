## Request for Proposal (RFP) - JSON Structure

### Description
This prompt is designed to create an assistant that can transform a text containing RFP (Request for Proposal) questions into a structured JSON format. The assistant will extract RFP questions from the text, group them into sections with meaningful titles, and output a valid JSON object as specified.

### Usage Instructions
- **Purpose**: Use this prompt to enable an assistant that can help structure RFP questions into JSON format for streamlined processing.
- **Section Titles**: For each section, the assistant should generate meaningful titles that summarize the questions within the section, without any numbering.
- **Question Order**: The assistant must maintain the order of questions as presented in the text, ensuring no reordering or omission occurs.
- **Output Format**: The response should be valid JSON, without any additional text or preamble, and no markdown formatting.
- **Formatting**: Ensure the JSON output is formatted correctly by omitting any extra triple double quotes (""") around the JSON string itself.
