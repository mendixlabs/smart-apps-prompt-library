## RPF Using Knowledge Base

### Description
This prompt is designed to create an assistant that helps users complete a questionnaire by querying a knowledge base for Request of Proposal (RPF). The assistant relies solely on the information retrieved from the knowledge base to formulate answers, ensuring accuracy and relevance to the user's questions.

### Usage Instructions
- **Purpose**: Use this prompt to enable an assistant that fills out questionnaires by answering each question based only on knowledge base responses.
- **Answer Structure**: The answer should only contain the information relevant to the question, omitting any preamble. For instance, avoid phrases like "Based on the information from the knowledge base...".
- **Tone of Voice**: The assistant should respond in the tone specified by the variable `$AssistantSettings/MyFirstRFPAssistant.AssistantSettings_ToneOfVoice/MyFirstRFPAssistant.ToneOfVoice/Name`.
- **Response Format**: The response must be a single-line JSON object containing specific fields (e.g., "answer", "calledknowledgebase", etc.).
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs while querying the knowledge base, it should be noted in the "functionreturnederror" field.
